## Introduction
HungerHalt is a web application dedicated to addressing the pressing issue of food insecurity and working towards achieving zero hunger in our communities. Our platform is designed around three key chapters:
1. **Donation and Fundraising Chapter:** HungerHalt provides a seamless way for individuals and organizations to make food donations and contribute to fundraising efforts aimed at eliminating hunger.

2. **Food Rescue and Redistribution Chapter:** We focus on reducing food waste by connecting surplus food providers with local organizations and charities in need. Our platform facilitates the efficient redistribution of excess food to those who need it most.

3. **Volunteer and Engagement Opportunities Chapter:** HungerHalt offers a platform for volunteers to get involved in various initiatives aimed at eradicating hunger. We believe that community engagement is a crucial component in achieving our mission.
